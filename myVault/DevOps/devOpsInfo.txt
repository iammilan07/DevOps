Development + Operation = DevOps

CI/CD is the heart of DevOps

Deelopment Team <→ Devops ↔ Operation Team ↔ Deploying Team, Managing Server


# Tools

GIT Commands 

Docker (like a container file)

CI/CD (Zenkin, Circle-I, Tutor)

Kubernetes

Programing Language

Linux (Shell scripting, batch-scripting) (Scripting language)

Azures Pipelines (SignIn and get started)

- DevOps is a state of mind that tries to implement the best practices using the DevOps tool.
- learn scripting that will help to automate repetition tasks.
- learn any one of the cloud providers like Azure, AWS, GCP.

- Linux: -

basic commands - Echo, Ls, rm-k, pwd, cp-r, cat, cd, touch

Linux file system, Os Basic, Virtualization, Shell Scripting (it helps to automate the smaller task), working with VM editor, disk management

- Networking

DNS configuration

How Traffic is controlled

Gateway

Routing

IP address and Ports

Switching

- GIT
